# Interest Profile Tracking System

The interest profile tracking system is a program intended to help users keep track of all of their interests over time. The Interest Profile Tracking System (IPTS) is especially useful in handling users with many interests that change over time. With each submission the user makes to the IPTS that user's Interest Profile will be updated such that reccuring interests are weighted and sorted to appear first in the list.

The result is such that overtime a user can build a list of all of their interests while seeing a trend emerge for what topics they are most consistently interested in.
